Product: Auditable FedRAMP-Aware CDK Platform
 Milestone: 1 â€“ The Foundational Engine & Component Library
 Audience: Platform engineers, compliance officers, pilot team developers

1. Product Overview
We are building an internal developer platform (IDP) built on AWS CDK that abstracts boilerplate, enforces enterprise guardrails, and accelerates delivery. Developers declare intent via a manifest (service.yml), and the platform resolves, validates, and deploys compliant infrastructure.
This product is designed to:
Empower developers with self-service infra.
Provide secure defaults and FedRAMP-ready guardrails.
Offer flexibility via overrides, hooks, and escape hatches.
Ensure compliance and auditability from day one.
Lay the foundation for a multi-tenant SaaS platform.

2. Goals & Non-Goals
Goals
Deliver a core engine + CLI with manifest-driven workflows (svc plan, svc up, svc local up).
Provide 4â€“5 workhorse components: lambda-api, lambda-worker, sqs-queue, rds-postgres, s3-bucket.
Support compliance frameworks: commercial, fedramp-moderate, fedramp-high.
Enforce policy-as-code (cdk-nag, custom rules).
Provide observability hooks (logs, metrics, alarms).
Enable config overrides, escape hatches, plugin components.
Produce auditable outputs (plan diffs, patch reports, suppression justifications).
Non-Goals
Not supporting non-AWS clouds in Milestone 1.
Not shipping advanced UI/portal (CLI + artifacts only).
Not building full AI assistant (autocomplete + schema validation only at this stage).

3. User Personas
Application Developer (primary)


Wants to ship business logic, not YAML spaghetti.
Needs fast local dev and safe cloud deploy.
Expects clear docs, scaffolds, and predictable DX.
Platform Engineer


Builds/maintains components and resolver.
Needs contracts, test harnesses, and contribution workflows.
Security/Compliance Officer


Needs enforceable guardrails (encryption, logging, IAM least-privilege).
Requires auditable reports (suppressions, patches, policy violations).
Pilot Team Lead / Engineering Manager


Needs visibility into adoption, costs, and policy trends.
Wants predictable versioning and support SLAs.

4. Functional Requirements (FR)
Core Engine & CLI
FR-1: Parse and validate service.yml against schema.
FR-2: Run svc plan to:
Show active compliance framework.
Run governance checks.
Output infra diff, cost estimate, policy findings.
FR-3: Run svc up to synthesize, bind, deploy infra.
FR-4: Run svc local up to emulate dependencies (SQS, Postgres, S3) via Docker/LocalStack.
FR-5: Emit outputs.json with all component-provided capabilities.
Governance
FR-6: Framework-specific policy packs (commercial, FedRAMP Moderate, FedRAMP High).
FR-7: All suppressions require: ruleId, justification, expiresOn, owner.
FR-8: Audit log all suppressions, patches, overrides.
FR-9: Fail builds on critical FedRAMP violations.
Components
FR-10: Provide minimal config but enforce security defaults:
rds-postgres: encrypted, deletion-protection on, subnet restricted.
s3-bucket: private, encrypted, versioning on.
sqs-queue: DLQ by default.
lambda-api/worker: tracing on, log retention default, VPC by default.
FR-11: Cross-framework variance (FedRAMP vs commercial) baked into defaults (e.g., KMS CMK vs AWS-managed keys).
Flexibility & Extensibility
FR-12: overrides block for allow-listed L2 properties.
FR-13: patches.ts escape hatch (full CDK object access).
FR-14: component.json contract for contributing new components.
FR-15: Versioned internal component registry.
Observability
FR-16: Standard alarms auto-created (Lambda errors, DLQ depth, DB CPU/storage).
FR-17: Log/trace/metric export hooks.

5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
NFR-1: CLI commands must complete in <10s for validation, <15m for deploy.
NFR-2: CLI must be deterministic; identical inputs yield identical plans.
NFR-3: Platform components must pass cdk-nag + unit + snapshot tests.
NFR-4: Audit artifacts (plan.json, outputs.json, patch reports) must be immutable and stored in central logging account (FedRAMP).
NFR-5: 99.9% CLI availability (if run in SaaS mode later).

6. User Stories (by persona)
Application Developer
US-AD1: As a dev, I can run svc init to scaffold a service with boilerplate manifest, handler, and patches file.
US-AD2: As a dev, I can define my service using a simple service.yml manifest.
US-AD3: As a dev, I can override default memory and timeout for my Lambda without breaking compliance.
US-AD4: As a dev, I can run svc plan to see cost estimates, infra diff, and compliance results.
US-AD5: As a dev, I can run svc local up to run my service locally with emulated dependencies.
US-AD6: As a dev, I can add a suppression with justification and expiry to silence a nag warning.
US-AD7: As a dev, I can write a patches.ts to extend my stack for advanced needs.
Platform Engineer
US-PE1: As a PE, I can publish a new component (e.g., keyspaces) to the internal registry with schema, docs, and tests.
US-PE2: As a PE, I can enforce mandatory tags across all resources.
US-PE3: As a PE, I can see which services are using which platform versions.
Security/Compliance Officer
US-SC1: As a security officer, I can enforce stricter defaults when complianceFramework=fedramp-high.
US-SC2: As a security officer, I can audit all suppressions and patches across services.
US-SC3: As a security officer, I can see which controls failed and why in plan output.
Manager/Pilot Team Lead
US-M1: As a manager, I can see adoption metrics for the pilot team.
US-M2: As a manager, I can ensure platform updates are versioned and non-breaking.
US-M3: As a manager, I can escalate support issues via the feedback loop.

7. Acceptance Criteria (summarized)
From the prior FedRAMP AC set, condensed here:
Schema validation fails clearly on missing/invalid fields.
Compliance framework selection loads proper policy pack.
Plan output shows active framework.
Commercial vs FedRAMP enforcement differences respected (KMS defaults, logging, deletion protection).
Suppressions require justification + expiry.
Escape hatches logged; FedRAMP requires manual approval.
Audit logs immutable.

8. Risks & Mitigations
Risk: Over-abstraction â†’ devs feel boxed in.
Mitigation: Overrides + patches + escape hatches.
Risk: FedRAMP compliance drift.
Mitigation: Versioned policy packs, CI enforcement, audit feeds.
Risk: Pilot friction in first 15 minutes.
Mitigation: Golden path docs + smoke tests + local dev parity.

9. Success Metrics
80% of pilot team services deployed via platform within 90 days.
0 critical compliance violations in FedRAMP mode.
50% reduction in infra boilerplate code vs baseline.
90% suppressions have valid justification/expiry.



MTTR reduced by 30% due to standardized observability.
