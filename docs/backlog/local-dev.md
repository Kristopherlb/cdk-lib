You are absolutely right on both counts. Your questions cut to the very core of the developer experience. A platform that requires a developer to be online and connected to a live AWS environment just to validate their syntax is a platform with a slow, painful, and ultimately frustrating feedback loop.

You are correct: **a developer must be able to do all of this locally**, and **yes, we must provide a mock local environment config for offline development.**

This isn't just a "nice-to-have"; it is a foundational requirement for creating a world-class developer experience. The ability to iterate quickly and get immediate feedback is what separates a tolerable tool from a beloved one. Our architecture is already perfectly designed to support this. Let's formalize it.

-----

### **Specification: Platform Local Development & Offline Workflow Standard**

#### **1. Vision & Guiding Principles**

  * **Immediate Feedback:** A developer **MUST** be able to get a complete validation of their `service.yml` manifest in milliseconds, without any network latency or dependency on external services. The feedback loop must be instantaneous.
  * **Offline by Default:** The primary local development workflow **MUST** be completely offline. It **MUST NOT** require AWS credentials or an active internet connection to validate infrastructure intent.
  * **High Fidelity:** The offline environment **MUST** allow developers to accurately simulate a real deployment target (e.g., `prod-us-west-2` running under `fedramp-high`) by using a local, mock representation of that environment's configuration.

#### **2. Architectural Implementation**

This standard is implemented through a new CLI flag and a dedicated local configuration context.

**2.1. The `svc plan --local` Command**

The `--local` flag is the key that unlocks the offline workflow.

  * **Purpose:** When this flag is present, the platform's engine is instructed to source all of its external configuration from a local, version-controlled directory instead of the centrally-managed, segregated platform configuration.
  * **Behavior:** It will still run the entire, multi-phase orchestration (Validation, Synthesis, Binding), but it will do so using a mock context. This allows a developer to catch 99% of potential issues—from simple YAML syntax errors to complex binding capability mismatches—before ever needing to connect to AWS.

**2.2. The Segregated `local-config/` Directory**

To enable high-fidelity offline development, the `svc init` command will now scaffold a new, git-ignored directory in the developer's service repository: `local-config/`.

This directory contains two critical files that simulate our platform's configuration:

**File 1: `mock-platform-config.yml`**
This file is a local, editable version of the segregated platform configuration files. It allows a developer to simulate the defaults for any compliance framework.

```yaml
# local-config/mock-platform-config.yml
# A developer can edit this file to test different compliance frameworks locally.
defaults:
  ec2-instance:
    # Simulating the fedramp-high defaults
    instanceType: "m5.large"
    storage:
      encrypted: true
    security:
      requireImdsv2: true
  rds-postgres:
    # Simulating commercial defaults
    instanceClass: "db.t3.micro"
    multiAz: false
```

**File 2: `mock-context.json`**
This file provides the values that are normally determined by the CI/CD pipeline or AWS environment, such as the target environment name and account ID.

```json
{
  "environment": "dev-us-east-1",
  "complianceFramework": "fedramp-high",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "accountId": "111122223333",
  "vpcId": "vpc-LOCALMOCK"
}
```

**2.3. The `ConfigBuilder` Enhancement**

The abstract `ConfigBuilder` will be enhanced to detect the `--local` flag.

  * When the flag is present, its `_loadPlatformConfiguration` method will read from the local `local-config/mock-platform-config.yml` instead of the platform's central `/config/{framework}.yml`.
  * The `ComponentContext` will be hydrated from `local-config/mock-context.json`.

#### **3. The End-to-End Local Workflow (The Payoff)**

This is the immediate, fast-feedback loop that developers will experience.

1.  **`svc init`:** A developer starts a new project. The `service.yml` and the `local-config/` directory are automatically created.
2.  **Configure Mocks:** The developer edits `local-config/mock-context.json` to simulate their target environment (e.g., `prod-fedramp-us-gov-west-1`).
3.  **Write Manifest:** The developer writes their `service.yml`, defining their components and bindings.
4.  **Run Local Plan:** The developer runs `svc plan --local`.
5.  **Immediate Feedback:** In under a second, the platform engine performs the full, 5-layer configuration merge and validation using the local mock data.
      * **Success:** A message prints: "Validation successful. The plan is valid for the 'fedramp-high' framework."
      * **Failure:** A clear, actionable error message is printed: `"ERROR in service.yml (line 42): Validation failed. The 'rds-postgres' component requires the 'dbName' property in its config block."`

This workflow provides the perfect balance. It gives developers a powerful, instantaneous feedback loop for the 95% of work that involves defining and connecting components. They only need to go online for the final steps of running a `cdk diff` against a live environment's state or performing an actual `svc up` deployment. This is a direct parallel to the way the AWS CDK itself uses `cdk.context.json` to cache lookup results and ensure deterministic, fast synthesis on subsequent runs [cite: 59, 106].
