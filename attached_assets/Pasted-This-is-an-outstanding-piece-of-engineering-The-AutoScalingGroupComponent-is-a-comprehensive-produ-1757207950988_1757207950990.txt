This is an outstanding piece of engineering. The AutoScalingGroupComponent is a comprehensive, production-grade implementation that correctly and thoroughly applies the complex, multi-layered compliance and hardening requirements we've specified.
The most important takeaway is that this component is a perfect example of the "CDK Construct Composer" architecture. It correctly instantiates and configures native CDK L2 constructs, which is the foundational principle of our entire platform.
Let's do a full review.
Final Code Review: AutoScalingGroupComponent
1. Overall Assessment
 * Status: âœ… APPROVED with minor required refinements.
 * Analysis: The component is architecturally sound and feature-complete. It correctly implements the Component API Contract, uses a robust internal structure, and expertly handles the three-tiered compliance model. The level of detail in the private helper methods demonstrates a deep understanding of both the AWS CDK and the enterprise security requirements.
2. Core Strengths
 * Correct Architectural Pattern: The synth() method correctly orchestrates the creation of real CDK L2 constructs (new autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup, new ec2.LaunchTemplate, etc.). This is the gold standard for how all components in our library should be built.
 * Thorough Compliance & Hardening: The logic to handle the differences between commercial, FedRAMP Moderate, and FedRAMP High is excellent. The use of separate helper methods for this logic (e.g., applyFedrampHighHardening, shouldRequireImdsv2) is clean and maintainable.
 * Good Internal Structure: The synth() method delegates its work to a series of private methods, each with a single responsibility (createKmsKeyIfNeeded, createInstanceRole, createLaunchTemplate, etc.). This makes the complex process of creating an ASG easy to follow and debug.
 * Capability & Handle Contracts: The component correctly registers its handles (registerConstruct) and provides its capabilities (registerCapability) with real, tokenized values from the created CDK constructs.
3. Required Refinements
The core logic is excellent. The following refinements are required to address a gap in the configuration handling and to align the component with the platform's standardized patterns.
1. Integrate the ConfigBuilder Pattern
 * Issue: The buildConfigSync() method at the end of the file is a simplified stub. The component's internal helper methods currently contain hardcoded defaults and logic that should be managed by our standardized Builder Pattern. This creates a tight coupling between the component's synthesis logic and its configuration logic.
 * Actionable Change:
   * Create a new AutoScalingGroupConfigBuilder class (in a separate file or within this one) that extends our abstract ConfigBuilder.
   * Move all the logic for determining default values (e.g., the switch statements in getInstanceClass and getDefaultRetention) into the appropriate methods of this new builder (getPlatformDefaults, getComplianceFrameworkDefaults, etc.).
   * Refactor the synth() method to use this builder as its first step to create the final, merged config object. The private helper methods will then be simplified to just read from this final, pre-calculated config object.
   * Benefit: This will decouple the configuration logic, make it reusable, and ensure that the configuration precedence chain is handled consistently across all components.
2. Complete the JSON Schema
 * Issue: The AUTO_SCALING_GROUP_CONFIG_SCHEMA is incomplete. It only defines a few properties, while the AutoScalingGroupConfig interface defines many more.
 * Actionable Change: Expand the AUTO_SCALING_GROUP_CONFIG_SCHEMA to accurately reflect the entire AutoScalingGroupConfig interface.
   * Benefit: This is critical for our CLI's validation pipeline and for providing accurate IntelliSense to developers using the platform.
3. Use Base Class ensureSynthesized()
 * Issue: The component defines a validateSynthesized() method, but our abstract Component base class already provides a standard ensureSynthesized() method for this purpose.
 * Actionable Change: Remove the validateSynthesized() method and update the getCapabilities() method to call this.ensureSynthesized() instead.
   * Benefit: This promotes consistency and code reuse across all components.
Conclusion
This is an exemplar component implementation. It successfully translates complex enterprise requirements into a secure, compliant, and powerful CDK construct. Once the configuration logic is refactored into a dedicated ConfigBuilder and the schema is completed, this component will be ready for production use and will serve as a definitive template for all future compute components in our library.
