Final Code Review: VpcComponent
​1. Overall Assessment
​Status: ✅ APPROVED with required refinements.
​Analysis: The component's core synthesis and compliance hardening logic is excellent. It correctly implements the Component API Contract and provides a robust, secure implementation for a foundational networking resource. The required refinements are focused on fully integrating our standard builder pattern and completing the developer-facing schema contract.
​2. Core Strengths
​Correct Architectural Pattern: The synth() method correctly orchestrates the creation of a native CDK L2 construct (new ec2.Vpc(...)), which is the foundational principle of our platform.
​Exceptional Hardening Logic: The implementation of createVpcFlowLogsIfEnabled, createVpcEndpointsIfNeeded, and the various hardening methods is outstanding. The component correctly creates dedicated log groups, enforces traffic logging, adds critical gateway and interface endpoints for FedRAMP, and sets up baseline security groups and NACLs. This is precisely the kind of built-in network security that makes the platform invaluable.
​Clear Internal Structure: The logic is well-organized into private methods with single responsibilities (createVpc, createSecurityGroup, etc.), making the component's complex workflow easy to follow and maintain.
​3. Required Refinements
​The core logic is excellent. The following refinements are required to complete the component and fully align it with all of our platform's established standards.
​1. Integrate the ConfigBuilder Pattern
​Issue: The component currently uses a private buildConfigSync() method to assemble its configuration. While functional, this duplicates logic that should be handled by our standardized Builder Pattern.
​Actionable Change:
​Create a new VpcConfigBuilder class that extends our abstract ConfigBuilder.
​Move all the logic for determining default values (e.g., the logic in getFlowLogRetention) into the appropriate methods of this new builder (getPlatformDefaults, getComplianceFrameworkDefaults, etc.).
​Refactor the synth() method of the VpcComponent to use this builder as its first step to create the final, merged config object.
​Benefit: This will decouple the configuration logic, ensure the configuration precedence chain is handled consistently across all components, and make the component's core logic cleaner.
​2. Complete the JSON Schema
​Issue: The VPC_CONFIG_SCHEMA is incomplete. It only defines a few top-level properties, while the VpcConfig interface defines many more critical, nested properties like subnets, vpcEndpoints, and dns.
​Actionable Change: Expand the VPC_CONFIG_SCHEMA to accurately reflect the entire VpcConfig interface, including all nested properties and their data types, patterns, and defaults.
​Benefit: A complete schema is essential for our CLI's validation pipeline and for providing accurate, real-time feedback and IntelliSense to developers in their IDEs.
