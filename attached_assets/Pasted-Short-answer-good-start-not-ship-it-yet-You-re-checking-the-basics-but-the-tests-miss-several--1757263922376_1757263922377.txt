Short answer: good start; not “ship it” yet. You’re checking the basics, but the tests miss several platform-level guarantees you’ve said are non-negotiable.

What’s solid

Creates bucket, AES256 encryption, and PublicAccessBlock.

Prod path covers versioning + a lifecycle rule.

FedRAMP branches check KMS-at-rest and a TLS-only bucket policy.

Capability & outputs present.

Sanity checks on CFN structure.


Gaps that matter (fix these to trust the component)

1. Tagging Standard not verified
Add assertions that every taggable resource (Bucket, Logging bucket, BucketPolicy if tagged, KMS Key if created) has: platform:service-name, platform:owner, platform:component-name, platform:component-type, platform:environment, platform:managed-by, platform:commit-hash.


2. FedRAMP logging & versioning posture incomplete



fedramp-moderate/high should require server access logging and versioning. Your mod test only checks logging; your high test doesn’t assert versioning==Enabled or that logs write to a separate log bucket with sensible retention (and not the same bucket).

Assert the log bucket itself is private, encrypted, has lifecycle to expire logs per framework (e.g., 1y mod, 10y high), and no logging loop.


3. KMS assertion is brittle
You assert an inline AWS::KMS::Key for fedramp-high. Many orgs import a central CMK. Prefer asserting:



BucketEncryption uses aws:kms,

BucketKeyEnabled: true, and

SSEAlgorithm: aws:kms with a non-AWS-managed key (presence of KmsMasterKeyId/BucketKeyEnabled), not that a new Key resource exists.


4. Public access posture needs more checks



Keep the PublicAccessBlock test, but also assert BucketPolicy denies:

Non-TLS (aws:SecureTransport == false) — you have this under High; add for Moderate if that’s your standard.

(Optional, if enforced) uploads missing SSE-KMS headers (s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption != aws:kms).


Consider asserting ObjectOwnership = BucketOwnerEnforced and ACLs disabled to kill ACL drift.


5. Removal semantics not covered



Assert RemovalPolicy according to framework: RETAIN for fedramp*, DESTROY allowed in commercial/dev. This is a real foot-gun.


6. Region-appropriate capability & binder preconditions



Capability test is fine, but add one that proves binders can read what they need (e.g., the capability includes the ARN and bucketName—you did—plus optional kmsKeyArn when KMS). This will prevent “write w/o key” issues in Lambda/ECS binders.


7. Lifecycle/compliance defaults precedence



Add tests that show platform defaults vs user overrides precedence: e.g., platform sets BucketKeyEnabled=true, user overrides to false in commercial → allowed; in fedramp-high → override is rejected (plan-time error). Your test suite should catch both behaviors.


8. Events & triggers path untested
Per your Trigger spec, buckets can trigger Lambda/SQS/SNS. Add at least one test that a config.triggers entry yields the correct NotificationConfiguration (or higher-level CDK wiring) and proper Invoke permissions on the target.


9. PublicAccessBlock resource vs Bucket property
Your test expects AWS::S3::BucketPublicAccessBlock. Depending on your implementation, CDK may model this inside the Bucket (L2 props) and not emit a separate resource. Make the test tolerant: assert the effective settings exist (either as a separate resource or inline props).


10. Error tests need specificity
Use message/regex (e.g., /bucketName is required/i, /invalid bucket name/i) so failures are actionable.


11. CORS / replication (nice-to-have)



If you support CORS or cross-region replication, add one positive test each. For CRR, assert the replication config forbids unencrypted destinations and uses role with minimum perms.


Minimal additions to get this “prod-ready”

Add Tagging assertions (all resources).

Add Versioning==Enabled & Access Logging to separate bucket with lifecycle under fedramp*.

Make KMS checks key-agnostic (customer-managed, bucket key enabled), drop hard dependency on an inline Key.

Assert RemovalPolicy per framework.

Add TLS-only deny in Moderate (if standard) and optional KMS-header deny.

Add trigger test (S3→Lambda) to validate your Trigger spec wiring.

Tighten error message assertions.


Do that, and this S3 component test suite will actually catch the problems that hurt teams in real environments.
