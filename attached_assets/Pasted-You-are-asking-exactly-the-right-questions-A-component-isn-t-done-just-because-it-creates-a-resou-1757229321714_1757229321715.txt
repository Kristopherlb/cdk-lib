You are asking exactly the right questions. A component isn't "done" just because it creates a resource; it's done when it fully participates in the entire platform ecosystem and adheres to all of our established standards.
I have reviewed the ApplicationLoadBalancerComponent from the Replit link.
Direct Answer: Yes, the code is a complete implementation of its core resource creation logic. There are no placeholders or half-finished examples within the functions that exist.
However, to answer your broader question, no, the component is not yet complete. It is missing the mandatory integration of several of our key platform-wide standards.
Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the missing standards and the required, actionable changes to bring the component into full compliance with our platform's specifications.
Platform Standards Compliance Review: ApplicationLoadBalancerComponent
1. Structured Logging Standard
 * Status: âœ… CONFORMS
 * Analysis: The component's implementation for applyFedrampModerateHardening correctly enables access logging and directs those logs to a central audit bucket. This is a perfect implementation of this standard for an ALB.
2. OpenTelemetry Observability Standard
 * Status: ðŸ”´ MISSING
 * Why it's missing: The current implementation does not create any standardized CloudWatch Alarms for the ALB's most critical operational metrics. While an ALB doesn't emit OTel traces itself, our observability standard mandates that all components provide out-of-the-box monitoring for their key health indicators.
 * Required Actionable Change:
   * Implement a _configureObservabilityForAlb private method within the component.
   * This method MUST be called from the main synth() method.
   * Inside this method, you MUST create a standard set of cloudwatch.Alarm constructs for the following essential ALB metrics:
     * HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count: To alert on a high number of server-side errors from the application targets.
     * UnHealthyHostCount: To alert when backend instances are failing their health checks.
     * TargetConnectionErrorCount: To alert on network connectivity issues between the ALB and its targets.
     * RejectedConnectionCount: To alert when the ALB is at its connection capacity.
3. Feature Flagging & Canary Standard (OpenFeature)
 * Status: ðŸ”´ MISSING (By Design)
 * Why it's missing: The ApplicationLoadBalancerComponent itself does not directly integrate a feature flagging SDK. Instead, it must be designed to enable progressive delivery strategies like canary deployments, which are orchestrated by the CI/CD pipeline. The current implementation only creates a single listener and target group, which is insufficient for these strategies.
 * Required Actionable Change:
   * Enhance the component's config schema and logic to support a deploymentStrategy block (e.g., deploymentStrategy: 'blue-green').
   * When a blue-green strategy is specified, the component MUST provision two elbv2.ApplicationTargetGroup constructs (a "blue" and a "green" target group).
   * It MUST also provision a elbv2.ApplicationListener that has the capability to be modified by AWS CodeDeploy to shift traffic between these two target groups.
   * The component's capability output MUST expose the ARNs of the load balancer, the listener, and both target groups so that the CI/CD pipeline has the necessary handles to orchestrate the traffic shift.
4. Other Missing Standards (from previous reviews)
The component is also missing the same foundational refinements as the other components we have reviewed. These must also be implemented:
 * ConfigBuilder Pattern: The component needs its own ApplicationLoadBalancerConfigBuilder to handle the layering of defaults and user configuration, decoupling this logic from the synth() method.
 * Complete JSON Schema: The APPLICATION_LOAD_BALANCER_CONFIG_SCHEMA must be expanded to cover the full set of properties in the ApplicationLoadBalancerConfig interface.
Once these standards are fully integrated, the ApplicationLoadBalancerComponent will be a complete, robust, and production-ready part of our platform library.
